```

## Troubleshooting & Notes

* Use Python 3.10+ to avoid deprecation warnings.
* Only **playlist URLs** are supported; profile/channel URLs are not.
* Special characters in video titles are sanitized automatically.
* Already downloaded songs are skipped; deleted songs can be re-downloaded.
* Script shows progress `[current / total]` for downloading, skipped, or missing songs.
* High-resolution album art is embedded automatically.
* At the end, a summary is displayed with: total songs, downloaded this run, already in folder, skipped (no video found).
